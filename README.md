# Polynex-Clientside
The client half of Polynex, the primary personal project I have been working on. This is where the majority of the code is, with over 80 character scripts and over 40 systm scripts. 

The majority of the scripts are located in individual character folders. For an example of a character script, navigate to Assets -> Characters -> Templar_Commander -> TemplarCommanderEnemy.cs

Other broad scripts for the characters are in the primary Assets folder. These are the parent scripts for the child character scripts.

The rest of the system scripts are in the Assets -> Scripts folder
